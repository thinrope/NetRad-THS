This kit is a THS[1] project in collaboration with Safecast[2]. Once you buy
and build your device, you own it (hardware and software) and the data it
produces. By default, with version 2.x the data can be sent to the Safecast
public API server[3] and subsequently visualized. A free account is needed.

To be able to update/change the firmware of your DIY GM counter, you'll need:
a) a toolchain to build (compile/link) the source for the microcontroler (ATMega328P)
b) a tool to upload the binary to the flash (e.g. avrdude)
c) way to access the source code and related libraries

One relatively simple way is to download the appropriate "Arduino IDE" for your
OS of choice from http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software since this provides both
a) and b) above.

To have your unit upload data to http://pachube.com/ you need to setup an
account with them, or use the THS shared account. To use the THS shared

Feel free to submit any issues (bugs, RFEs) via the Github's tracking system.


To use the bleeding edge, on Linux:

cd sketchbook
git clone https://github.com/thinrope/NetRad-THS.git
cd NetRad-THS/
git checkout testing
git submodule init
git submodule update
cd src/netrad_ths
# edit the config
make
make upload
make monitor
